pointer is JUST a location and doesn't NEED a type, 


code: 
	int variable = 8; // this has a memory address

	void* nullPointer = 0; // memory address of 0/nullptr, not valid
	void* variablePointer = &variable;

View memory values: 
	Debug > Windows > Memory > memory1



---------------------
pointers are just integers that store memory address, 

memset(
	pointerToBlockOfMemory, 
	ValueToBeSetThere, 
	NumberOfBytesAsUnsignedIntegralType);
